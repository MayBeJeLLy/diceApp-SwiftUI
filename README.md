Today I would like to tell you about an exciting project I am working on. Let's take a look at the story of the "Dice App" together.
There are two dice in our project. These dice, like the standard dice that are part of our lives, have values from 1 to 6. Each time, they take a random value and display these values and the sum of the dice on the screen.
But this is not just a dice app. If the dice roll 1-1, the app offers you a heartfelt piece of advice. This small detail was added to add a personal touch to the project.
When developing the app, I wanted users to not only roll the dice, but also have a fun learning experience. Don't miss the opportunity to add a little fun and maybe a little advice to your life, as well as the luck of the dice!
I had fun developing the project and I hope you enjoy using it as much. I wish everyone success and enjoyable use!
